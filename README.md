## Hi there üëãüèª
I‚Äôm a Mechanical Engineering graduate of 2016 batch. I come with an extensive learning  with different technologies including Python, Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Mechanical field to Software field it is quite challenging. But i have potential to do tough & new things. I worked in core mechanical field for 3.4 years in various dept.- NPD, PPC, QA etc. The big thing what i have achieved there is to give dedication to your work, learning new things & most important is, 'doing' all things in best way.

Whenever i came up across with analysis of data, i searched for -what exactly market is dealing with data. And this is reason which moves me towards executing maths in machine!!! 

Now, I am looking for a full-time role in Data Science, Machine Learning or related field.
